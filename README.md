# Competition_modeling
Notes and code from my rotation with the Naegle lab (modeling competition between phosphotyrosine binding partners)

Running the models to generate the data included in this repository requires the BioNetGen package (BioNetGen.org). Once BioNetGen has been downloaded, copy sample_vars_pulse.pl and the .bngl files included in this repository into the Perl2 subdirectory of the directory in which BioNetGen has been installed. Once this has been done, it should be possible to run the sensitivity analyses/parameter scans using the terminal commands included in the Python_analysis.ipynb notebook
